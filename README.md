# Pamflet
Pamflet is a flashcard app that lets you create and study cards in a more engaging way. Using [pamflet dsl](https://github.com/craftzniac/pamflet-dsl-kotlin) (which is a tiny markup language), you can design:
- Regular text elements for straightforward notes
- Multiple-choice elements that let learners actively select answers and test their knowledge.
- Include links for additional resources
